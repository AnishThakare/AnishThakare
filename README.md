- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnishThakare
- 👀 I’m interested in programming small games and robotics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple game projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: At times where people ask me what my fun fact is, I'll try to think of something interesting but instead change the topic. Anyway play my games!
